I like to code stuff :)

# My Main Skills
I am trying to specialize in Android and IOS app development, I am well versed in many other fields such as Linux kernel development, small to medium scale PHP Server management, SQLite Database maintenence and hardware implementations through micro controllers.

# Why I have this GitHub page?
To share some of my more useful projects and make sure people have a way to access and work on them.
